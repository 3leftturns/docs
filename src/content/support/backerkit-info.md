BackerKit Questions & Answers
===

###When will the Electron Ship?

All kickstarter backers and pre-orders for the Electron will start shipping **October 2015**.


###How do I access my BackerKit account?

To **access your account or change a shipping address**, please check the email address that was used when you backed us on **Kickstarter**.
The email should look a little like this:

###How do I upgrade my BackerKit Pledge Package?

Once you are logged into your BackerKit account, you will be able to see your current pledge amount and package. After,
clicking the "Get Started" button you will be taken to a screen that allows you to grab additional add-ons
to you original pledge package from Kickstarter. You’ll be able to add on Electrons, Kits, and T-Shirts!

###Other common BackerKit concerns

**I pledged extra for additional items.**
BackerKit automatically pulls in the amount you pledged and allows you to specify the items you added on money to get.

**I think I might be moving before the fall.** That’s okay! We’re sending surveys pretty early so we can start getting reward information, but we will not be locking addresses down until this fall. You will always have access to your BackerKit profile and will be able to update your shipping address yourself. When we get close to address lockdown date we’ll send you some reminders so you can make any last minute changes. In the meantime, feel
free to use this [link](https://spark-electron-cellular-dev-kit-with-a-simple-data.backerkit.com/) to change your address and other account information.

**I’m a t-shirt level backer and I haven’t received a survey.** We have already emailed these out so please <a onClick="script: Zenbox.show(); return false;"> email us </a>if you haven’t received the survey in your inbox.
