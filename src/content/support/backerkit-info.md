Kickstarter Account & Electron Information
===

###When will the Electron Ship?

All kickstarter backers and pre-orders for the Electron will start shipping **October 2015**.


###How do I update my account information?

To access your account to **update credit card or shipping address**, please check the email address that was used when you backed us on **Kickstarter**.
The email should look a little like this:

If you cannot locate the email we sent to you, refer to this link below to
access your BackerKit account that will allow you to update your Kickstarter information.

###How do I upgrade my Kickstarter Pledge Package?

Once you are logged into your BackerKit account, you will be able to see your current pledge amount and package. After,
clicking the "Get Started" button you will be taken to a screen that allows you to grab additional add-ons
to you original pledge package from Kickstarter. You’ll be able to add on Electrons, Kits, and T-Shirts!

Feel free to the link below to jump straight to your cart for more Add-Ons!

###Other common Kickstarter concerns

**I pledged extra for additional items.**
BackerKit automatically pulls in the amount you pledged and allows you to specify which items you want to get with your additional credits.

**I think I might be moving before Fall 2015.** That’s okay! We've already started sending surveys to get reward information, but we will not be locking addresses down until this fall. You will always have access to your BackerKit profile and will be able to update your shipping address yourself. 

When we get close to address lockdown date we’ll send you some reminders so you can make any last minute changes. In the meantime, feel
free to use this [link](https://spark-electron-cellular-dev-kit-with-a-simple-data.backerkit.com/) to change your address and other account information.

**When will my credit card be charged?** Your credit will not be charged until your package has shipped!

**I’m a t-shirt level backer and I haven’t received a survey.** We have already emailed these out so please email us at [ particle@io dot com] if you haven’t received the survey in your inbox.
