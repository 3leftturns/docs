Account & Shipping Issues
===

###Where is my order?

If you'd like to track your order, please find your **OrderID #** that was given at checkout and in the order confirmation email. Also, provide the **email address** that was used to checkout at the [store.particle.io](https://store.particle.io/) or kickstarter site.

<!-- Then, use this --> <a href="https://dashboard.trycelery.com/status" class="button">Check My Order</a> <!--button and use the information to retrieve your [order invoice](https://dashboard.trycelery.com/status) and [cart information](https://dashboard.trycelery.com/status).-->



###Updating My Address

It is possible to update your shipping address if your <a>Fulfillment</a> status is not already in {{{support-popup '**processing**' 'img' 'invoice_status_processing.png'}}} or {{{support-popup '**fulfilled**' 'img' 'invoice_status.png'}}} stages. If your order is in the {{{support-popup '**payment = unpaid**' 'img' 'invoice_status_unpaid.png'}}} stage, it is possible to update your address on your own using the same **OrderID #** and **email address** provided at checkout. 

Once you are logged into the dashboard, click the **edit** button near your {{{support-popup '**shipping**' 'img' 'invoice_shipping.png'}}} section to update your mailing address.

###Updating My Credit Card 

Similar to updating you address, updating your **credit card information** is just a simple. Again, if your order is in the {{{support-popup '**payment = unpaid**' 'img' 'invoice_status_unpaid.png'}}} stage, you will be able to update the credit card on file using the same **OrderID #** and **email address** provided at checkout to sign into the dashboard.


Once you are logged into the dashboard, click the **edit** button near your {{{support-popup '**Payment Source**' 'img' 'invoice_payment.png'}}} section to update your credit card information.

###Can I Cancel My Order?
