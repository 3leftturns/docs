###Where is my order?

If you'd like to track your order, please find your **OrderID #** that was given at checkout and in the order confirmation email. Also, provide the **email address** that was used to checkout at the [store.particle.io](https://store.particle.io/) or kickstarter site.

<!-- Then, use this --> <a href="https://dashboard.trycelery.com/status" class="button">Check My Order</a> <!--button and use the information to retrieve your [order invoice](https://dashboard.trycelery.com/status) and [cart information](https://dashboard.trycelery.com/status).-->



###Updating My Address
It is possible to update your shipping address if your <a>Fulfillment</a> status is not already in {{{popup '**processing**' 'img' 'invoice_status_processing.png'}}} or {{{popup '**fulfilled**' 'img' 'invoice_status.png'}}} stages.

If your order is in the {{{popup '**payment = unpaid**' 'img' 'invoice_status_unpaid.png'}}} stage, it is possible to update your address on your own using the same **OrderID #** and **email address** provided at checkout. 

Once you are logged into the dashboard, click the **edit** button near your {{{popup '**shipping**' 'img' 'invoice_shipping.png'}}} section.
