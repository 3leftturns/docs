Particle and Microsoft have teamed up to provide a 1st-class
integration with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/" target="_blank">Azure IoT Hub</a>.
Azure IoT Hub provides a seamless way to get Particle device data
into Azure, effective both during prototyping and when at scale.

Acting as the "front door" to Azure, streaming from Particle into IoT Hub will
make it easy to forward device data onto any of
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/"

robustness to your IoT product or application. Here are some examples of
things you could do with Particle + Azure IoT Hub:

- Predict when a piece of equipment needs maintenence ahead of time using
  predictive analyctics
- Detect anomalies in product behavior by analyzing device data from an
  entire fleet simultaneously
- Trigger a notification to a device owner when supplies are running low
