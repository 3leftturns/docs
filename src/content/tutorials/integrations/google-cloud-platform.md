# {{title}} Integration

Particle has teamed up with Google to create a 1st-class integration
with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Cloud
Platform</a>. Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test,
and deploy applications on Googleâ€™s highly scalable and reliable
infrastructure.

Platform with ease</p>

Streaming data from Particle devices into Google Cloud Platform creates
countless opportunities to add intelligence and robustness to your IoT
product. Here are some examples of things you could do with Particle +
Google Cloud Platform:

- Store data from a fleet of devices in a durable, long-term hosted
  database
- Combine data sources from an entire fleet into unified data flows that
  provide product-wide business intelligence
- Take action in the physical world based on results of predictive 
  analysis on a historical data set

Google's Cloud Platform is comprised of <a
href="https://cloud.google.com/products/" target="_blank">dozens of
products & services</a>,
providing you with a variety of potential IoT applications.

Some of the most relevant Google Cloud Platform products to use with Particle are:
- <a href="https://cloud.google.com/datastore/" target="_blank">Cloud Datastore</a>: A highly-scalable NoSQL database for your web and mobile applications
- <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/" target="_blank">BigQuery</a>: A fast, economical and fully managed data warehouse for large-scale data analytics
- <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/" target="_blank">SQL</a>: A fully managed MySQL database service
- <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/" target="_blank">Cloud Dataflow</a>: A fully-managed cloud service and programming model for batch and streaming big data processing
- <a href="https://cloud.google.com/prediction/" target="_blank">Prediction API</a>: Machine learning to analyze your data and make predictions

Many of these products relate to data storage. For more information on finding the right data storage option for your particular use case, check out
the docs on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage-options/" target="_blank">choosing a storage option</a>.
This tutorial will focus on the first example use case: storing data from
Particle devices into Google Cloud Platform Datastore.

## Preconfiguration

Regardless of which Google Cloud Platform product(s) you'd like to use,
streaming data into Google Cloud Platform requires an entry point.
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview"
target="_blank">Google Cloud Pub/Sub</a> provides a scalable,
flexible and reliable entry point for Particle device data into
Google Cloud Platform.

<p class="caption">Device data gets routed through the Particle Cloud into Google Cloud Pub/Sub. You can then use that data in
any number of Google Cloud Platform products.</p>

The Particle cloud will *publish* device data to a Pub/Sub *topic*.
Once inside, Google Cloud Platform, any number of *subscribers* can listen for
messages sent to the topic, and relay them to other Google Cloud
Platform products & services.
