title: Building your own web app
columns: 2

In many cases, you will want to set up your own web service that interacts with your users' products. At a high level, there are two types of web applications you might consider building:

- A custom web interface your users will use to interact with their hardware
- A back-end web service for automated interactions (e.g. turn on the lights when the sun sets)

Our APIs allow you to build both types of web services, although access controls are somewhat different for users (who have a login/password) and automated web services (which can request access with a variety of permissions). You can build these web services in any programming language (Javascript/Node.js, Ruby, Python, C#, PHP, etc.), although we provide the most support for Javascript/Node.js through our [ParticleJS] Javascript SDK. If you are interested in libraries for interacting with our APIs in other programming languages, please [search our forums](https://community.particle.io) for community-generated libraries.
