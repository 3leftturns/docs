While using your Photon, you've probably come across our Particle mobile apps (iOS and Android). You may have used these apps to set up your device and "tinker" with the GPIO pins.

Particle provides native mobile SDKs for both iOS (Objective-C and Swift) and Android (Java) that allow you to build your own branded app for setting up and interacting with your product. If all you need is the set-up process, you can build your own branded app by editing a 15-line configuration file (no software development necessary). If you want to build a complete mobile interface, our iOS and Android SDKs provide native access to our API for interfacing with the product.
