For Particle-powered products that rely on cellular connectivity,
seamless management of a fleet of SIM cards quickly becomes a necessity.
SIM Management for products equips product creators with the
functionality needed to operate at scale with a large number of
cellular-connected devices that rely on Particle SIMs. This suite of
tools is focused on reducing friction of managing a fleet of SIM cards
at all stages of the SIM lifecycle.

Some of the ways SIM Management for products provides value include:
- Batch-import and activate SIM cards
- View fleet-wide statistics on data usage and estimated monthly
  data cost
- Set fleet-wide sensible defaults, but still get granular control of
  individual SIM cards

## Product ownership

Much like devices, SIM cards can now be associated with a Particle
product instead of an individual Particle developer. It is important to
be aware of a few implications of product ownership of a SIM card:

- The owning product takes billing ownership over the SIM card and its data
  usage costs
- Any member of the owning product team gains access to view and manage the SIM
  (i.e. deactivation, changing the data limit)

## Importing SIM Cards

### Transferring SIMs owned by a developer

### Importing via files

### Typing/scanning ICCIDs

## Default Data Limits

## Monitoring your fleet

## Billing and invoicing
