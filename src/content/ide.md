Logging In

If you want to work on more advanced projects, local IDE could be the choice for you. Head over and download our IDE:

[Spark IDE Download >](https://www.spark.io/ide)

![IDE Window]({{assets}}/images/ide-window.jpg)

To access most of features you need to log in using your Spark account (which you can [create here](https://www.spark.io/signup)) by clicking link on the bottom of the window.

Enter your email and password then click the "Log In" button. After quick verification, dialog will hide and link from the bottom will show your current account email.

**NOTE**: Using [Command Line](/cli) you'll notice that log-in status is shared between IDE and CLI. So if you successfully ran `spark login`, you will be logged in within IDE.

Selecting Core

![Selecting Core]({{assets}}/images/ide-select-core.jpg)

Most of features like **Flashing** or accessing **Cloud variables and functions** requires selecting which Core they will interact with.

There are three ways to select core:

* click **Select Core** button in the left toolbar
* click Core's name on the bottom of the window
* click on **Spark** -> **Select Core...** menu

Then you will see list of all your Core along with online indicator. You can search for specific one by typing its name. Clicking on Core or pressing `Enter` when Core is selected, will make it the current one.
