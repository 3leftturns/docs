If you want to work on more advanced projects, local IDE could be the choice for you. Head over and download our IDE:

[Spark IDE Download >](https://www.spark.io/ide)

![IDE Window]({{assets}}/images/ide-window.jpg)

To access most of features you need to log in using your Spark account (which you can [create here](https://www.spark.io/signup)) by clicking link on the bottom of the window.

![Log in]({{assets}}/images/ide-log-in.jpg)

Enter your email and password then click the "Log In" button. After quick verification, dialog will hide and link from the bottom will show your current account email.

**NOTE**: Using [Command Line](/cli) you'll notice that log-in status is shared between IDE and CLI. So if you successfully ran `spark login`, you will be logged in within IDE.
