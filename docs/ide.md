Find and use a library

![open the library drawer](images/library-icon.png)

The first step in using a library is finding one that will work
for your project. Start your search by clicking the library icon
to open the library drawer, from here you'll be able to peruse
available libraries, see which libraries are most popular, and view
examples, source code, and documentation contributed by the community.

Once the drawer is opened, you'll see the list of libraries you've published (My Libraries), as well as community libraries contributed by others (not shown).

This list of libraries is ordered by the number of apps that include it.
You can click any of the library names to view details about it.
